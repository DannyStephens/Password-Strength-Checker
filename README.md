# Password Strength Checker
This is a simple Python program that checks how strong your password is. It looks at how long your password is, how complex it is, if it’s a common password, and if it has repeated characters.

### What It Does:
Checks the length of your password

Checks if your password has uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Checks if your password is in a list of common passwords (like "123456" or "password")

Checks if your password has repeated or patterned characters

Gives you a score and tells you how strong your password is

### What You Need
Python 3 installed on your computer

A file called rockyou.txt (a list of common passwords).
You need to put this file in the folder:
/content/drive/MyDrive/rockyou.txt
(Or you can change the path in the code to wherever your file is)

### How to Run
Save the code in a file, for example: password_checker.py

Open a terminal or command prompt

Run the program with:

bash
Copy
Edit
python password_checker.py
Enter your password when asked — it will be hidden as you type

See how strong your password is!

### Notes
The program does not show your password on the screen

If your password is found in the common list, it will always be marked very weak

This is a basic tool and should not replace professional security tools

### Future Improvements
Add a bigger list of common passwords

Estimate how long it would take to crack the password
